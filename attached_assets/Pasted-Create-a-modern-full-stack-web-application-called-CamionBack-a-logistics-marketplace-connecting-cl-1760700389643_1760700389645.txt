Create a modern full-stack web application called CamionBack — a logistics marketplace connecting clients who need transport (furniture, freight, deliveries, etc.) with independent transporters who own trucks or vans.

🌍 Core Roles:

1️⃣ Client:

Authentication only via phone number (no email) using OTP verification.

Can publish a transport request (from city → to city, description, goods type, date/time, optional budget, photos).

Can view offers received from drivers (with amount, truck photo, and driver ranking).

Can chat internally with drivers (real-time chat filtered to remove phone numbers/links).

Can accept one offer per order.

2️⃣ Transporter:

Registration by phone number and truck photos (no ID uploads required).

Dashboard to browse all available client requests with city filters.

Can submit a price offer and send a message to the client.

“My Offers” tab showing pending, accepted, or completed proposals.

3️⃣ Administrator (Back Office):

Full dashboard to manage clients, transporters, and requests.

Can manually add new transporters and grant them login access.

Can upload/edit truck photos for transporters.

Can view all requests, see the ID number of each order, and all offers submitted (e.g. “Transporter X offered 500 MAD for Order #145”).

Can validate or reject offers, update commission percentages, and track payment proofs.

Has access to global statistics (number of users, trips, commissions, best drivers, etc.).

⚙️ Key Features:

Real-time chat system with automatic number/link filtering (regex for +212, 06, 07 formats).

WhatsApp notification integration (Twilio API) when new requests are published.

Commission logic: total price includes a hidden CamionBack fee.

Drivers upload payment proofs; admin validates them manually.

Each transport request has a clear reference ID (e.g. CMD-2025-00145).

🖌️ Design & Tech:

Modern mobile-first UI inspired by your reference screens: dark teal background (#0a2540 / #163049), minimal rounded cards, large readable fonts.

Use React + Next.js for frontend, Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for styling, and Node.js + MongoDB backend.

Include authentication, dashboard navigation, file upload system (for photos and payment proofs).

Use responsive card layouts similar to a mobile app, with buttons: “Choisir cette offre”, “Envoyer un message”, and “Nouvelle demande”.

Include ranking stars (⭐) and photo previews of trucks.

📈 Admin KPIs:

Total active clients & drivers

Total requests posted & completed

Deliver a mobile-friendly, clean and professional interface, optimized for Moroccan users, simple, fast, and visually consistent with the CamionBack design shown.
